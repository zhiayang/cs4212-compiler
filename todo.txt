TODO

1. all the other statement and expression types
	- println
	- readln
	- conditional branch (on relops and consts)
	- dotop
	- dotop assigns
	- new
	- unary ops
	- func calls
	- strings

2. a not-3head register allocation scheme. presumably this entails:
	- liveness analysis
	- probably go with the graph colouring method
	- `VarState` needs to account for the current statement
	- 4head way of determining register spill cost

3. constants > 4095 need to be handled
	- either do `ldr reg, =#999999`, or...
	- manually construct the value using instructions (potentially up to 3 instructions)

5. strings...
6. long division

7. investigate whether we want to make bools 1 byte
