TODO

1. support functions:
	- readln
	- string concat
	- long division


4. find some way to tell the register allocator about caller-saved registers
	- ideally we want some way to automatically spill a1-a4 across a function call
	- maybe by having calls "def" a1-a4, but those are registers and not variables...


11. see if we need (want) to toposort the basic blocks before renumbering/allocating

12. combine push/pop pc with save/restore callee-regs if the stack frame is empty
	(right now we emit 2 consecutive stmfd/ldmfd instructions)
	(we might do this as an optimisation pass)

17. register allocation coalescing

19. see if it's possible to "properly split" the live ranges. right now, even though there might be disjoint parts in a var's
	live range, the var must still use the same register (or spill) throughout.

	if possible, split it up, so that we can (eg.) perform partial spills, and/or use a different register for different
	subranges of the live range.


21. peephole optimisations


22. when doing -O0 code, zero locals?
