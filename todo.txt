TODO

1. all the other statement and expression types
	- readln
	- conditional branch (on relops and consts)
	- dotop
	- dotop assigns
	- new
	- unary ops
	- strings

2. a not-3head register allocation scheme. presumably this entails:
	- liveness analysis
	- probably go with the graph colouring method
	- `VarState` needs to account for the current statement
	- 4head way of determining register spill cost

5. strings...
6. long division

7. investigate whether we want to make bools 1 byte

9. main wrapper needs to allocate an instance of Main, though this can be on the stack i guess. it's size
	0 anyway (since Main cannot have fields by the syntax definition)

10. classes can have no fields; naively calling malloc(0) will return null.


-- for now, we decided to just modify the caller stack.
8. investigate whether the spilling "backup" is required. arm specs say:
	"A callee can modify any stack space used for receiving parameter values from the caller."
	Procedure Call Standard for the Arm Architecture, Release 2020Q2 (page 24)
