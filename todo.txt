TODO

11. see if we need (want) to toposort the basic blocks before renumbering/allocating

17. register allocation coalescing

19. see if it's possible to "properly split" the live ranges. right now, even though there might be disjoint parts in a var's
	live range, the var must still use the same register (or spill) throughout.

	if possible, split it up, so that we can (eg.) perform partial spills, and/or use a different register for different
	subranges of the live range.


22. when doing -O0 code, zero locals?
	- no bonus for this so wgt
