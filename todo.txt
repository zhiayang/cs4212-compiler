TODO

1. all the other statement and expression types
2. a not-3head register allocation scheme. presumably this entails:
	- liveness analysis
	- probably go with the graph colouring method
	- `VarState` needs to account for the current statement

3. constants > 4095 need to be handled
	- either do `ldr reg, =#999999`, or...
	- manually construct the value using instructions (potentially up to 3 instructions)

5. strings...
6. long division
